    /*
    The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens on an 8Ã—8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other;
    thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
    There are 92 solutions. The problem was first posed in the mid-19th century.
    In the modern era, it is often used as an example problem for various computer programming techniques.
